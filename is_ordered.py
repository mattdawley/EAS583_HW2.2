	Takes a block number
	Returns a boolean that tells whether all the transactions in the block are ordered by priority fee

	Before EIP-1559, a block is ordered if and only if all transactions are sorted in decreasing order of the gasPrice field

	After EIP-1559, there are two types of transactions
		*Type 0* The priority fee is tx.gasPrice - block.baseFeePerGas
		*Type 2* The priority fee is min( tx.maxPriorityFeePerGas, tx.maxFeePerGas - block.baseFeePerGas )

	Conveniently, most type 2 transactions set the gasPrice field to be min( tx.maxPriorityFeePerGas + block.baseFeePerGas, tx.maxFeePerGas )
